## Why Filmater?

    Filmater is an app that allows users to share their favorite movies with the community. I truly enjoy movies, and learning other's favorites! This made it very easy for me to focus on the project, as it was an interest in mind. 

## How to Use:

    The home page welcomes you with a quick description of the app: submit, comment and share your favorite movies with the community. If you haven't already, you're given a hyperlink to the login screen, where you'll sign in, or, if need be, given the option to register within one convenient space. Once the user is logged, they are free to browse the app with the help of the NavBar located at the top of the project. The user can see the current genres being used under the Genre tab and as they continue, see the submissions of other users favorite movies! User will be able to edit or delete a movie listing. User can submit a new movie under the Submission tab by filling out a simple form.

### Main Structure Used

    MongoDB
    Express
    React
    Node.js

### Area of Improvement

    Implement CRAP styling properties (CSS in general)
    Dropdown menu of genres in MovieGallery page to make it easier for user
    Create a Show Page when movie is clicked on, will show more detail w/comment section
    When user logs in, user stays logged into app until they log out
    Make sure log in credentials are being verified with DB (currently, any login, right or wrong, will be succesful)
    User can only edit/delete post that were created by them.
    Use movie API to fill in submission form with what user does not know
